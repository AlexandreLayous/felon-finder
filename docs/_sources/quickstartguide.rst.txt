Method 1 - Using the installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Windows**

| `FelonFinder_1.0.3_WIN_x64_setup.exe <https://zenodo.org/records/10963074/files/FelonFinder_1.0.3_WIN_x64_setup.exe?download=1>`_
| Simply execute the setup and you will be able to open the software on the go.

**Linux**

| `Felon_Finder_1.0.3_LINUX_setup.deb <https://zenodo.org/records/10963074/files/Felon_Finder_1.0.3_LINUX_setup.deb?download=1>`_
| You can double click on the package with a GUI or use ``dpkg -i Felon-Finder.deb`` to unpack it and run it once it's over.

Method 2 - conda environment + pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 1) First, create a conda environment with the adequate Python version.
| Whether you operate under Windows or Linux, enter this command in your terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ conda create --name felon-finder python=3.12.2

.. warning::
    
    If for some reason you feel lost at this first step, we strongly recommend `installing Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_ and `getting started with this tutorial <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_.

| 2) The next step is to activate your conda environment with the following command :

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate felon-finder

| 3) Now that the environment is set up, you can download and install the required packages with this single command line :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexandreLayous/felon-finder/main/requirements_linux.txt

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexandreLayous/felon-finder/main/requirements_win.txt

| 4) Once the environement is activated and the requirements are installed, please install the ``felonfinder`` package with pip from your terminal :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install felonfinder

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install felonfinder[windows]

.. note::

    Windows operated computers need one more dependency to work with the ``tensorflow`` package.

| 5) You can now run Felon Finder by typing this command line in your terminal :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ felon-finder

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ felon-finder-win

.. warning::

    Unlike its pip package, the actual Felon Finder executable contains dashes in its name !

.. note::

    Once this setup has been done for the first time, you shouldn't have to do it again unless you delete your conda environment or the files needed.

    You will just have to activate the conda environment every time before running the software.

Method 3 - conda environment + GitHub clone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Felon Finder is almost ready to launch once you clone the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/AlexandreLayous/felon-finder>`_.

| 1) In order to clone the repo, you can proceed with the method of your choice. For instance, with *SSH*, you can type the next commands in your command-line terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:AlexandreLayous/felon-finder.git
    $ cd felon-finder

| 2) Create a conda environment with the adequate Python version.
| Whether you operate under Windows or Linux, enter this command in your terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ conda create --name felon-finder python=3.12.2

.. warning::
    
    If for some reason you feel lost at this first step, we strongly recommend `installing Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_ and `getting started with this tutorial <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_.

| 3) Activate your conda environment with the following command :

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate felon-finder

| 4) Install the required dependencies with the following command :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_linux.txt

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_win.txt

| 5) You can then type the next command in your command-line terminal to run the software :

.. code:: console

    $ python FelonFinder.py

.. note::

    Once this setup has been done for the first time, you shouldn't have to do it again unless you delete your conda environment or the files needed.

    You will just have to activate the conda environment every time before running the software.
