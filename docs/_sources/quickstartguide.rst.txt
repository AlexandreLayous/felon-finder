How to install and use the software
-----------------------------------

In order to install Felon Finder and launch, multiple ways are possible.

Method 1 - Using the installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Windows**

| `FelonFinder_WIN_x64_setup.exe <https://mega.nz/file/WqpwXLJA#ZB9scKeus0Q8n7NazQAzil0lMsszJEYG-sLESxlg6zY>`_
| Simply execute the setup and you will be able to open the software on the go.

**Linux**

| `Felon-Finder.deb <https://mega.nz/file/6nIQjY5b#NDvn5pGsyfHgSv_mLno5mF9Statr6tozO5qahtbECi0>`_
| You can double click on the package with a GUI or use ``dpkg -i Felon-Finder.deb`` to unpack it and run it once it's over.

Method 2 - conda environment + GitHub clone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Felon Finder is almost ready to launch once you clone the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/AlexandreLayous/felon-finder>`_.

| 1) In order to clone the repo, you can proceed with the method of your choice. For instance, with *SSH*, you can type the next commands in your command-line terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:AlexandreLayous/felon-finder.git
    $ cd felon-finder

| 2) The next step is to **download the model** for the autoencoder from `this mega.nz link <https://mega.nz/file/3ugxgCLJ#74M6kIoyRPdf0SIFeNGPF4kr4vzezE-MnJwNp0YHWHc>`_ and **place it where it belongs**, which corresponds to the empty ``saved_model`` folder.

| Once you moved the model ``felon_finder_vae.weights.h5`` in ``felon-finder/saved_model``, your workspace just needs a little more configuration.

| 3) Create a conda environment with the adequate Python version.
| Whether you operate under Windows or Linux, enter this command in your terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ conda create --name felon-finder python=3.12.2

.. warning::
    
    If for some reason you feel lost at this first step, we strongly recommend `installing Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_ and `getting started with this tutorial <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_.

| 4) Activate your conda environment with the following command :

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate felon-finder

| 5) Install the librairies required with the following command :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_linux.txt

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements_win.txt

| 6) You can then type the next command in your command-line terminal to run the software :

.. code:: console

    $ python FelonFinder.py

.. note::

    Once this setup has been done for the first time, you shouldn't have to do it again unless you delete your conda environment or the files needed.

    You will just have to activate the conda environment every time before running the software.

Method 3 - conda environment + pip 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| 1) First, create a conda environment with the adequate Python version.
| Whether you operate under Windows or Linux, enter this command in your terminal :

.. code:: console

    $ conda create --name felon-finder python=3.12.2

.. warning::
    
    If for some reason you feel lost at this first step, we strongly recommend `installing Miniconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/>`_ and `getting started with this tutorial <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html>`_.

| 2) The next step is to activate your conda environment with the following command :

.. code:: console

    $ conda activate felon-finder

| 3) Once the environement is activated, please install the ``felonfinder`` package and its dependencies with pip from your terminal :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install felonfinder

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ pip install felonfinder[windows]

.. note::

    Windows operated computers need one more dependency to work with the ``tensorflow`` package.

| 4) Now, you need to **download the model** for the autoencoder from `this mega.nz link <https://mega.nz/file/3ugxgCLJ#74M6kIoyRPdf0SIFeNGPF4kr4vzezE-MnJwNp0YHWHc>`_ and **place it where it belongs**.

| You have to find the directory where felon-finder was installed. In order to do this, you can type the following command :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ which python

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ where python

| According to your OS, you might get something like this :
| ``/home/your_name/miniconda3/envs/felon-finder/bin/python``
| Or maybe this :
| ``your_disk:\Users\your_name\miniconda3\envs\felon-finder\python.exe``.

| **Forget everything after felon-finder/**. We will focus on felon-finder itself.
| Use the following commands to **navigate and create a directory in this folder** :

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ cd your_disk\path\until\envs\felon-finder\Lib\felonfinder
    $ mkdir saved_model

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ cd /path/until/envs/felon-finder/lib/felonfinder
    $ mkdir saved_model

.. note::

    Be aware of the slashes ! They're slashes in Linux but backslashes in Windows.

| **Congratulations !** Now, you only have to put the downloaded model in this folder and you are ready to go.

| 5) You can now run Felon Finder by typing this command line in your terminal :

| **Linux**

.. code:: console

    $ felon-finder

| **Windows**

.. code:: console

    $ felon-finder-win

.. warning::

    Unlike its pip package, the actual Felon Finder executable contains dashes in its name !

.. note::

    Once this setup has been done for the first time, you shouldn't have to do it again unless you delete your conda environment or the files needed.

    You will just have to activate the conda environment every time before running the software.
